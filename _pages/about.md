I'm a PhD student in Symbolic Systems within Stanford's Philosophy department, advised by [Thomas Icard](https://web.stanford.edu/~icard/). My work sits at the intersection of (the philosophy of) cognitive science and machine learning; I also have a growing interest in normative questions around AI's development and deployment.

Here is my [CV](assets/pdf/Harding_CV.pdf). Here is my [Google Scholar Page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VzPtr7EAAAAJ&hl=en).

To contact me, you can rearrange and combine "@", "hardingj", "stanford.edu".
